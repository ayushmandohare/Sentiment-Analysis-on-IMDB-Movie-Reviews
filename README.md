# 📝 Sentiment Analysis on Reviews (SVM Model)

A machine learning project that performs **binary sentiment classification** (Positive / Negative) on text reviews using **TF-IDF Vectorization** and a **Support Vector Machine (SVM)** classifier.  
The project includes a deployed **Streamlit web app** where users can test the model in real time.
